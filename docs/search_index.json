FAS OnDemand gives Harvard students access to Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio, and can be launched directly from Canvas. It is hosted by Harvard’s FAS Research Computing group (FAS RC) and collaboratively supported by both FAS RC and FAS Academic Technology. Why are we using FAS OnDemand for DataFest? It can sometimes be challenging in large courses to get every participant’s personal computer set-up with the necessary software. For this DataFest bootcamp, you will need an up to date R or Python environment with a suite of non-default packages/modules installed. FAS OnDemand provides you access to an environment that has been curated specifically for DataFest2021, so you can focus on learning skills, rather than debugging your software installation. In addition, you can access FAS OnDemand directly from within the DataFest2021 course on Canvas. When using the FAS OnDemand environment, you will have access to resources that include: 8 cores 16Gb RAM 20Gb storage 10Tb scratch storage (shared between all users on the course) Of course, if you prefer to use your own local R or Python environment on your personal computer that is perfectly fine, but we will not be able to provide assistance to you if you encounter problems setting that up correctly. The FAS OnDemand DataFest2021 Jupyter Notebooks installation comes with a Python 3 jupyter kernel, common data science packages such as numpy, scipy, seaborn, pandas, bokeh, and matplotlib, as well as many specialized modules we’ll use during DataFest. The FAS OnDemand DataFest2021 RStudio installation is available for R 4.0.3 and comes preinstalled with common packages such as devtools, learnr, and the complete tidyverse collection of R packages, as well as many specialized packages we’ll use during DataFest.

Once completed, you will be running an RStudio or Jupyter session with all necessary packages pre-installed. RStudio Click FAS OnDemand in the left-side navigation panel within Canvas. On the Dashboard launcher page, on the left-side panel, click on Rstudio Server - DataFest2021. On the main panel, click the blue Launch button. On the Sessions page, click on the blue Connect to RStudio Server button. You should now have access to RStudio. You can create a new R/Rmarkdown file as usual, or open an existing file. "],

These copies will serve as your own personal version of the files, which you can modify as you wish. There are several different ways you can copy files from the shared_data directory to your Home directory, depending on whether you’d prefer to use the command line or a GUI. Here are the options: RStudio: using Terminal Click on the Terminal tab on the top left panel, next to Console. Copy the file(s) or directories you want from the “shared_data” directory to your home directory: cp -r shared_data/&lt;directory-you-want&gt;/ . RStudio: using shell commands in the console Copy the file(s) or directories you want from the shared_data directory to your home directory by running the following command in the console: system(&quot;cp -r ~/shared_data/&lt;directory-you-want&gt;/ .&quot;) RStudio: using File menu In the Files menu in the bottom right panel, navigate to the shared_data directory. Navigate to the directory with materials for the current session. Put a check next to the file you want to copy to your home folder. You can only copy one file at a time and no directories. Click on the More dropdown menu (with gears icon) and select Copy To. Near the top of the resulting pop-up window, click on the Home directory icon. Click the Save button on the bottom right. There will now be a copy of the file in your home directory, which you can open and work with. Jupyter: using Terminal Click on the New dropdown on the right side of the page. Select Terminal from the dropdown menu. In the new browser tab, copy the file(s) or directories you want from the shared_data directory to your home directory: cp -r shared_data/&lt;directory-you-want&gt;/ . Close the browser tab containing the Terminal (don’t click logout!). Go back to the previous browser tab to access Jupyter again. Jupyter: using shell commands in cells Open a Jupyter Notebook or create a new cell. Copy the file(s) of interest to your home directory: !cp -r ~/shared_data/&lt;directory-you-want&gt;/ . Jupyter: using File menu Navigate to the file of interest within the shared_data directory. Click Duplicate from the top menu. Select the radio button next to the duplicated file. Click Move from the top menu. Delete ALL of the file path in the pop-up window and click the blue Move button "],
